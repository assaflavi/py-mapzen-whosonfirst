# py-mapzen-whosonfirst-bundle

A (mostly working as-in-almost-there...) package to install all the other Who's On First Python packages

## Important

This package **WILL BE RENAMED**. It started life as `py-mapzen-whosonfirst-bundle` but that now interferes with the [dedicated package for generating data "bundles"](https://github.com/whosonfirst/py-mapzen-whosonfirst-bundles) and since it is early days we will do this. But we haven't yet.
